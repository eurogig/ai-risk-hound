# RiskRover - AI Risk Detector for Git Repositories

## Project Overview

RiskRover is a tool designed to scan Git repositories for AI components and assess potential security risks. The tool analyzes repository files, identifies AI libraries, frameworks, and code patterns, and provides actionable insights into security vulnerabilities.

## Features

- **Simple Repository Analysis**: Enter a GitHub repository URL and receive a comprehensive risk assessment
- **AI Component Detection**: Identify AI libraries, frameworks, and patterns in your codebase
- **Security Risk Assessment**: Get insights into potential vulnerabilities related to AI implementation
- **Remediation Suggestions**: Receive actionable recommendations to mitigate identified risks
- **Code References**: View specific locations in your codebase where AI components are used

## Usage

1. Visit the web interface
2. Enter the URL of the GitHub repository you want to analyze
3. Click "Analyze Repository" and wait for the results
4. Review the detailed risk report with identified AI components, security risks, and remediation suggestions

## Technical Details

### Web Interface

The web interface is built with:
- React
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Shadcn/UI components

### API (Simulated)

In a full implementation, the API would be built with:
- FastAPI (Python)
- Asynchronous processing for repository analysis
- GitHub API integration for repository access
- Signature-based and heuristic detection algorithms

### Future Extensions

- Command-line interface (CLI) for local analysis
- Importable Python library for integration with other security tools
- Continuous monitoring with webhook support for new commits
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines for automated security scanning
